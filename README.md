# Learning C# 🚀

Welcome to the **Learning C#** repository! This project serves as a comprehensive log and collection of code snippets, exercises, and projects created while mastering the C# programming language and the .NET ecosystem.

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my journey from a beginner to an advanced C# developer. It includes fundamental concepts, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and practical implementations using the latest .NET features.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following modules:

* **01-Basics**: Variables, Data Types, Type Casting, and Operators.
* **02-Control-Flow**: Conditional statements (if-else, switch) and Loops (for, while, do-while, foreach).
* **03-Methods**: Parameters, Return types, Overloading, and Recursion.
* **04-OOP-Concepts**:
* Classes and Objects
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism (Overloading vs. Overriding)
* Encapsulation (Access Modifiers)
* Abstraction (Abstract Classes & Interfaces)


* **05-Collections**: Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries, and Queues.
* **06-Error-Handling**: Try-Catch blocks and Custom Exceptions.
* **07-Advanced**: LINQ, Delegates, Events, Generics, and Async/Await.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **Language**: C# 12.0+
* **Framework**: .NET 8 / .NET Core
* **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022 / VS Code
* **CLI**: dotnet CLI

## 🚀 How to Run the Code
